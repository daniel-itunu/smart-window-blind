## Final year University project: Smart window blind
In manual mode, the blind is put into action by activating any of two push buttons for the tilting control.
In automatic mode, the blind opens or closes depending variability of environmental parameters detected by different sensors.
System function will include timing to open and shut the window blind, analyzing of environmental parameters collected by sensors, setting upper and lower limits of environmental brightness, reasonably controlling of window blind, receiving IoT based wifi module’s data and open and close according to data’s content and sending data of the environment state at the moment into the web, setting manual and automatic switch buttons.
In manual state, it is controlled remote controlled.
